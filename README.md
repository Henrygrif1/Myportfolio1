#### Space Game
Blast your way through space! Use your laser cannons to destroy incoming rocks and survive as long as you can. Each level gets harder, with more rocks and faster action!

 Game Features:

Laser Shooting: Fire lasers to destroy space rocks (asteroids).

Rocks (Enemies): Dodge or destroy incoming rocks to stay alive.

Levels: Complete levels by clearing all rocks. Each level gets harder!

Health System: Your ship has health — lose health when hit by rocks. Game over when health reaches 0.
