#### Space Game
Space Game is a 2D arcade-style survival shooter where the player pilots a spaceship through dangerous space filled with incoming asteroids. The objective is to destroy all enemies, survive each level, and progress through increasingly difficult waves.

The game focuses on fast reaction time, precise movement, and effective shooting. As levels progress, the number of asteroids increases and their speed becomes faster, creating a more intense and challenging experience.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

The player controls a spaceship that can move around the screen and fire lasers.

Asteroids spawn and move toward the player.

The player must shoot asteroids before they collide with the ship.

Each level is completed by clearing all asteroids.

The game ends when the player’s health reaches zero.

🔧 Core Game Systems

Player Movement System – Smooth directional movement allowing precise control.

Laser Shooting System – Fire projectiles to destroy asteroids.

Enemy Spawning System – Asteroids spawn in waves that increase in difficulty.

Collision Detection – Detects collisions between lasers, asteroids, and the player.

Health & Damage System – The player loses health upon impact with asteroids.

Level Progression – Each completed level increases enemy speed and count.

⭐ Key Features

Progressive difficulty for long-term replayability

Clear win and lose conditions

Arcade-style action with fast pacing

Simple but effective game design focused on core mechanics

  ## Projects for Term 2

### VelociKart Racing

VelociKart Racing is a fast-paced top-down racing game created as a group project during Term 2 of my Game Development class. The goal of this game is to race against opponents and cross the finish line first, while mastering movement mechanics, collision detection, and strategic use of power-ups and obstacles.

We worked together as a team to design the core gameplay systems and build exciting race tracks. My role included creating artwork and contributing to game logic implementation alongside my teammates.

 Key Features

 Top-Down Racing Gameplay — Drive fast and turn precisely as you navigate race courses.

 Collision Handling — Detect and respond to collisions between players, track boundaries, and obstacles.

 Power-Ups & Obstacles — Avoid hazards and use power-ups strategically to gain the advantage.

 Team Project — Built collaboratively with classmates, supporting teamwork, version control, and shared problem-solving.

 Code & Structure

This project includes:

Asset files (images, sounds, sprites)

Source code for vehicle movement, track logic, collision systems

User interface and race flow logic (start, finish, and game state management)
