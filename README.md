  ## Projects for Term 2

### VelociKart Racing

VelociKart Racing is a fast-paced top-down racing game created as a group project during Term 2 of my Game Development class. The goal of this game is to race against opponents and cross the finish line first, while mastering movement mechanics, collision detection, and strategic use of power-ups and obstacles.

We worked together as a team to design the core gameplay systems and build exciting race tracks. My role included creating artwork and contributing to game logic implementation alongside my teammates.

 Key Features

 Top-Down Racing Gameplay — Drive fast and turn precisely as you navigate race courses.

 Collision Handling — Detect and respond to collisions between players, track boundaries, and obstacles.

 Power-Ups & Obstacles — Avoid hazards and use power-ups strategically to gain the advantage.

 Team Project — Built collaboratively with classmates, supporting teamwork, version control, and shared problem-solving.

 Code & Structure

This project includes:

Asset files (images, sounds, sprites)

Source code for vehicle movement, track logic, collision systems

User interface and race flow logic (start, finish, and game state management)
